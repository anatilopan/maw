# Robert A. Stan's Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website (`index.html`).

It serves two main purposes:

1.  To establish a simple online presence.
2.  To act as a hands-on project for re-learning and experimenting with modern web development practices (HTML, CSS, potentially JS in the future), which can be applied to other projects.

## Features (as of v0.1.0)

*   **Main Page (`index.html`):** Basic structure including header, content sections, and footer.
*   **Custom Styling (`main.css`):**
    *   Light and Dark mode support via CSS variables and `prefers-color-scheme`.
    *   Responsive design for basic adaptability.
    *   Unique SVG logo with hover effects.
    *   Custom styling for lists, sections, and dividers.
*   **CSS Reset (`reset.css`):** Uses Meyer's Reset for cross-browser consistency.
*   **SVG Logo/Favicon (`simple-flag.svg`):** Reusable vector graphic.
*   **Test Page (`testing.htm`):** A dedicated page containing numerous HTML elements to facilitate CSS development and testing.

## Development

*   The primary custom styles are located in `main.css`.
*   The `testing.htm` page is designed to be used extensively during CSS development to ensure styles are applied correctly across various elements. As mentioned, future development will focus on expanding `main.css` to style all elements present in `testing.htm`.
